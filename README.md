# TooltipCleaner

This is a fairly simple addon aimed at removing some clutter from the default game tooltips.

The goal is to clean up the tooltips for those that prefer a cleaner, more minimalistic display, or just give room for other addons to add the info in a more orderly fashion without getting some of the information double up, as sometimes happen.

This is a new project I made on request, and you should consider it to be in development and open for suggestions as to what to clean up or reformat. If it's in line with the description above, I'm willing to consider adding whatever you might suggest!

## What it does

Currently it removes vendor sell price. And that's about it.
